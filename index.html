							<h2>Our first date August 14, 2024</h2>
							<p>Before our date, we had been talking for only 4 weeks since we started on July 23, 2024. 
								Going into the date, I had planned everything to make it worthwhile for you and to ensure you were as comfortable as possible
							</p>

							<h2>We hit it off great</h2>
							<p>We vibed perfectly and harmoniously, and we got along great. You mentioned that you're not very expressive, but I could feel 
								your genuine care and affection through your words and actions when I was with you. There’s no doubt in my mind that I want to treat you the best I possibly can.
								That...

								God made you as a way for to somewhat be closer to him and I thank God for that and I thank God as well to letting us meet. We also went to play billiards
								with misty and Of course after that we went....

							<h2>One of my fave picture (my other faves are all of our other pictures)</h2>
							<p>This will be long I think, Bub -- Cat, I never expected to found someone and to be honest I was at the time na I wasn't searching for anyone anymore
								but you came along bub and I am so glad to meet you I don't know what or who to give thanks but you and God. I met you and I cannot believe how someone like you
								exists...

							<h2>My Bub</h2>
							<p> just want to thank you so much, and to be honest, I can’t thank you enough for letting me be part of your life, for allowing me to know you better, for letting me 
								take care of you, and for letting me love you the way you want to be loved. I can’t promise that it will always be sunshine and rainbows for us; there will be times 
								when we might fight, argue, or have misunderstandings. But all I can say is that I will be with you through it all. I’ll be there in your highest moments, and I’ll 
								definitely be there during your lowest. I hope I can be the safe space you need, the person to hold you when you break down, and I will do my best to take care of you 
								and love you as much as I can.

							<h2>Monthsary - August 24, 2024</h2>
							<p>A month has passed so quickly and yet I have never been  bored nor got tired talking to you spending time with you and just being with you
								I felt at peace with you to the point that I get sleepy was open with you about everything and just was "ME" around you I never had to fake anything nor
								put up a face with you, you accepted me as a whole as "Gab" and wanted to know me better I felt that a lot the way you understand me, give time, make efforts and just everything
								meant everything for me that I will treasure every second that we spend together whether online or personal I loved being with you as you  make me happy and I hope I make you happy as well Bub
